Its a real-life training script that has been succesfully used in production several times already.

The first task is to add a nice interface for inference in order to be able to easily apply trained models to footage from within Flame.
The second stage is to modify dataset and create a ssimple interface for training to be able to feed data directly from Flame framestore.
